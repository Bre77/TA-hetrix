This app is a Modular Input that pulls uptime monitoring details from Hetrix Tools (hetrixtools.com). It simply requires an API key from your Hetrix account and will pull all uptime monitors.

Events are timestamped with the uptime monitors last checked time, and are skipped if the site hasnt been checked since the last event, in order to prevent duplicates.
